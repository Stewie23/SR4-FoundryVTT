Upstream project (SR5):
https://github.com/SR5-FoundryVTT/SR5-FoundryVTT

Project Status

Early development / work in progress.

The system loads and runs in Foundry

Actor sheets and skills are functional

Rules automation is incomplete and changing

Expect missing features, rough edges, and breaking changes and stuff still using 5th Edition thing, because i did not get to change them

This project is not yet recommended for long-running campaigns unless you are comfortable updating worlds and data manually.
